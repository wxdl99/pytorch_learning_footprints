# pytorch_learning_footprints
As a master student in the last year of study, I am preparing for my PhD travel,that is, to build new optical tools for the neuro-study. I want to drive this car called pytorch and use my GPU as a strong engine. As mentioned by the name of this repository, I want to write down my steps to master this extraordinary tool. Good Luck for meÔºÅ

# Device
All this code will run on Apple Macbook Air with M1 chip. The code are tested on an environment of conda torch-mps with python 3.9.21. 
Librairies used: pytorch, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

# Goal
As a student without the background in computer science, I suggest myself to focus on three key points:
1. Understand the basic concepts of deep learning and neural networks.
2. Know different types of neural networks and study stragegies.
3. Various applications of transfer learning and fine-tuning.
