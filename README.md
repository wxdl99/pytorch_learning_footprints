# pytorch_learning_footprints
As a master student in the last year of study, I am preparing for my PhD travel,that is, to build new optical tools for the neuro-study. I want to drive this car called pytorch and use my GPU as a strong engine. As mentioned by the name of this repository, I want to write down my steps to master this extraordinary tool. Good Luck for meÔºÅ

# Device
All this code will run on Apple Macbook Air with M1 chip. The code are tested on an environment of conda torch-mps with python 3.9.21. 
Librairies used: pytorch, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

# First stage for learning pytorch
1. Install pytorch and other libraries
2. Create a simple neural network, such as a simple linear regression model
3. Train the model on a dataset, to see what is going on in the model
4. Understand the basic concepts of pytorch, such as layer, model, loss, optimizer, etc.
