# pytorch_learning_footprints
As a master student in the last year of study, I am preparing for my PhD travel,that is, to build new optical tools for the neuro-study. I want to drive this car called pytorch and use my GPU as a strong engine. As mentioned by the name of this repository, I want to write down my steps to master this extraordinary tool. Good Luck for meÔºÅ
